COALESCE() - To return NULL values as 0. It takes multiple inputs and intelligently returns the first non-null value.

SELECT COALESCE(book_rating, 0) FROM goodreads;
If book_rating is NULL, return 0. If book_rating has a value (non-null), return that value.

IFNULL - It will return NULL values as 0, but return first values as same whether it is null or not null values

COALESCE() offers more flexibility when dealing with multiple values.
IFNULL() is a more concise option when you have two values to work with.

Ex: Table Values
NULL
5
7

with COALESCE funtion output will be
0
5
7

with IFNULL funtion output will be
NULL
5
7
