COALESCE() - To return NULL values as 0. It takes multiple inputs and intelligently returns the first non-null value.

SELECT COALESCE(book_rating, 0) FROM goodreads;

It will return 0 which book_rating column contains NULL values.

IFNULL - It will return NULL values as 0, but return first values as same whether it is null or not null values

COALESCE() offers more flexibility when dealing with multiple values.
IFNULL() is a more concise option when you have two values to work with.

Ex: Table Values
NULL
5
7

with COALESCE funtion output will be
5
7
NULL

with IFNULL funtion output will be
NULL
5
7
