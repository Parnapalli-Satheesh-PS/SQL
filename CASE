CASE - The CASE statement in SQL allows you to shape, transform, and manipulate data based on specified conditions.

SELECT 
CASE
WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1
WHEN condition_2 THEN result_2
WHEN....THEN.... 
ELSE result_3 -- If no condition matches, return the result in ELSE clause 
END AS new column_name 
FROM table name;

Example:

SELECT
page,
categoty,
avg likes,
CASE
when avg likes >= 1000 THEN 'Super Likes'
when avg likes BETWEEN 500 and 999 THEN 'Good Likes'
when avg likes < 500 THEN "Low Likes' end as corresponding_likes_category FROM fb_pages;
